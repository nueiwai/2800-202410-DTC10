## Project Title

**Dronify**

## Project Description

**Dronify** is a web application that deploys autonomous drones (on-demand) to offer package delivery and roadside assistance for autonomous car owners during accidents, thereby reducing delivery time and traffic congestion.

## Technologies used

For the **front-end** we used:

* **Flowbite** as our UI library

For the **back-end** we used:
* **Mapbox API** for the map interface and the foundation for the visual interface
* **Turf.js** for routing display on the map
* **Geolocation API** for getting the user’s current location
* **Open Weather API** for our Easter egg
Cloudinary for populating user’s profile image

For the **database** we used:
* **MongoDB** for hosting our data collection (user’s personal information, user’s session, battery station geo-coordinates)

## File Contents
TBD

## How to Run Our Project
To get started with Dronify, the hosted version of the product can be used. You can get started immediately [here](https://dronify-mbme.onrender.com/). After the login page, you will be greeted with our three core features to select from.

## AI Usage
**Project Support:**
* Our App Logo is generated using ChatGPT 3.5
* Although we did not use AI directly integrated in our app, we used it for code analysis - the old “explain this to me”
* We used it to minimize the risk of human error when working with long and possibly redundant lines of code (e.g. copy-and-paste fail)

**Data Sets:**
* Non-applicable, the only data set utilized in this project is is the geoJSON data set used to plot EV Battery Stations

**AI Integration:**
* Our app does not directly use AI

**Limitations Encountered:**
* Integration testing is hard for the current “free” models of AI to do well, when there are many components of the application coming together and working together in a somewhat delicate manner, it is hard for the current AI models to fully capture this well and provide accurate trouble-shooting
