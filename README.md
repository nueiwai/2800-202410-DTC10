## Project Title

**Dronify**

## Project Description

**Dronify** is a web application that deploys autonomous drones (on-demand) to offer package delivery and roadside assistance for autonomous car owners during accidents, thereby reducing delivery time and traffic congestion.

## Technologies used

For the **front-end** we used:

* **Flowbite** as our UI library

For the **back-end** we used:
* **Mapbox API** for the map interface and the foundation for the visual interface
* **Turf.js** for routing display on the map
* **Geolocation API** for getting the user’s current location
* **Weather API** for our Easter egg
Cloudinary for populating user’s profile image

For the **database** we used:
* **MongoDB** for hosting our data collection (user’s personal information, user’s session, battery station geo-coordinates)
